		<h1>My Favourite Pet!</h1>
		<p><img src="images/germanshepherd.jpeg" alt="A cute doggie c;">Honestly, I don't know what to choose between a dog or a cat, infact i would rather pick both, but if I was brutally forced to pick one, then I just might pick a german shepherd. They're the most adorable things in the world and very intelligent, though they make tons of mess around in the first few months of their life, but I can't resist the desire to own one. On top of being an intelligent breed, german shepherds are also:
		<ul>
			<li>strong</li>
			<li>courageous</li>
			<li>obedient</li>
			<li>excellent in focus, loyalty, tenacity </li>
		</ul>
		Because a german shepherd has a lot of energy, it is important that you battle it until he is satisfied by resting or relaxing. You could play fetch with him or chase him around a wide field with room for him to run at his best. Toys will come in handly at a time like night when you can't play with him due to darkness, so buying toys for him to play around with or chew should keep him busy until dawn. Some recommended toys for german shepherds are:
		<ul> 
			<li>Kong CLassic Dog Toy</li>
			<li>Thether Tug Dog Toy</li>
			<li>BingPet Tough Durable CHew Braided Rope</li>
			<li>Kong Air Dog Squeakair Tennis Ball Dog Toy</li>



		</ul>
		Infact, you could even have a cat to accompany him. German shepherds make friends with other animals easily (i think..).
